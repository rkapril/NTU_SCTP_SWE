The `var` keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The `let` and `const` keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use `var`.

If you want a general rule (cannot be changed): always declare variables with `const`.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use `let`.

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with `$` and `_`
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
